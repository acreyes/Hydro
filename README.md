Hydro Dynamics Codes
====================

Picks up at end of Assignment 4 from Computational Physics course at NYU(Fall 2013)

Goal is to write a 2nd order 2-D hydro code to see Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.

Includes
--------
* 1D_hydro.c -- First order in time & space, 1-D
* 1D_hydro_2ndO.c -- 3rd order in time, 2nd in space, 1-D
* 2D_hydro.c -- 3rd order in time, 2nd in space, 2-D
